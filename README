Steps to test driver.c interface:

1) compile imoab.o 
   cd src
   make imoab.o
2) compile driver
   cd ../test
   make driver 
   // test driver with ./driver p8ex1.h5m
   // test driver with mpiexec -np 4 ./driver p8ex1.h5m

Notes about this example file:
 does not have overlapping neumann sets! (material sets are of course, non overlapping)
I added a dirichlet set, manually, value 3; about 15 vertices are part of it (top)
it contains 4 material sets, and 8 parts; after ghosting, more material sets will be visible 
on each task (the same it is maybe true for neumann sets)

this file is copied from https://svn.mcs.anl.gov/repos/SHARP/trunk, modules/unic/short_term_MOAB
It was checked in by Vijay, to test changes to moab parallel reader in 2012!!
