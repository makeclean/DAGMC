Notes about this example file:
does not have overlapping neumann sets! (material sets are of course, non overlapping)
does not have dirichlett sets at all
it contains 4 material sets, and 8 parts; after ghosting, more material sets will be visible 
on each task (the same it is maybe true for neumann sets)

this file is copied from https://svn.mcs.anl.gov/repos/SHARP/trunk, modules/unic/short_term_MOAB
It was checked in by Vijay, to test changes to moab parallel reader in 2012!!
